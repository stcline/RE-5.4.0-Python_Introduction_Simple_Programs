# :robot: RE-5.4.0-Python Introduction Simple Programs

## ü§ì In this lab you will begin to interact with the Python environment which is included in a Jupyter Notebook.  While these basic commands will seem pretty simple at first, they will begin to introduce the Python language.

The goal of this lab assignment is to continue using the Jupyter framework to learn some basic Python commands. üöÄ

## Find the file here called, "5.4.0-Python_Introduction_Simple_Programs.ipynb". Work through the text and problems found in that notebook.  Pay attention to syntax and basic concepts like order of operations.

## üíª Terms to know
- Python `print()`
- Mothematical Order of Operations
- Python comments

## üìù Next steps
1. Complete the work in the notebook here (5.4.0-Python_Introduction_Simple_Programs.ipynb).
2. After you are done, add a text box at the bottom which describes what you learned about Python in this lesson.
3. After the text box, add a code block which does all of the following:
    - Utilizes the `print()` statement to print text and a math calculation together as in the examples but which is unique.
5. Download the notebook as an ".ipynb" file on your computer.
6. Rename the file as "Python_Simple_Programs.ipynb" and upload it to this repository.
